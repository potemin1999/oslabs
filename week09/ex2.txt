1. if you want maximum hit rate, you should load each page you would access at maximum once
   sort it by number (min or max sort, does not matter) and start accessing

2. minimum hit rate can be achieved, if you will try to access page which was unloaded from 
   memory in last tick or a little earlier. In other words, you should not have repeatable elements
   in any subarray with length of ram page capacity. I've tried to implement it with counting sort,
   but something went wrong :(
